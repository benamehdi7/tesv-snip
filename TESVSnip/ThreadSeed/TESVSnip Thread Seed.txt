[size=5][color=#00BFFF]TESsnip 4.4.2a (Skyrim Edition)[/color][/size]

[size=4][color=#FF0000]This is an experimental version for testing only. Please do not circulate plugins made with this version until more testing has been performed.[/color][/size]

TESVSnip is a fork of the TESsnip utility bundled with Fallout Mod Manager for Skyrim. In the word of the original author, "TESsnip is a low level plugin editor that allows you to open esm/esp files, view the record structure and cut/copy/paste records and subrecords between different parents, including different esp's. You can also view and edit the data saved in a subrecord, in either hex or string format, as well as editing record headers."

[size=5][color=#00BFFF]Info[/color][/size]

The skyrim-plugin-decoding-project currently working on TES5Dump, in preparation for TES5Edit will also be hosting and improving on TESVSnip. The version hosted is Figment's version 4.2, with Wmrojer's additions of 4.3 previously hosted on the Nexus.

Currently Leandro Conde and Smaug our two volunteers are no longer working on the project. Hopefully they will have a chance to return and help make more changes to the source code.

We are looking for C# programmers that are willing to contribute to the project and produce a working copy of TESVSnip that will function as intended.

The issue tracker on our site is set up for TESVSnip and I welcome any bug reports that cover version 4.4.2a. Feature enhancements are also welcome but they will be low priority until the version is stable enough to facilitate additional features. If a feature is currently implemented but not functioning correctly it will be resolved once the more critical issues are resolved.

[size=5][color=#00BFFF]Notes:[/color][/size]
- The check box on the LString record editor is for controlling whether to
store the integer ID (which is in Hex) or to store the actual text.
- When checked it stores the actual text. When not checked it stores the id.

[size=5][color=#00BFFF]TODO:[/color][/size]
- Substructures like MO2T and MO3T have complicated repeating structures not possible to edit currently
- Sorry the new string editor got away from me and is rather
fiddly and not intuitive but that is in line with TESsnip anyway
- Detect localization or allow selection of localization in future
- Add/update spell to convert from ESP to ESM which also fixes LString types
